# Candle Predictor: Deep Neural Network for Financial Forecasting

Welcome to the Candle Predictor, an innovative web application designed to forecast the high, low, and closing values of financial candles using advanced deep learning techniques. This project harnesses the power of neural networks to analyze time-series data, providing users with predictions that can inform their trading decisions.

Features
Real-Time Predictions: Utilize a trained deep neural network to predict the high, low, and close of financial candles.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with React, our frontend offers an intuitive experience for users to interact with the prediction system.
Robust Backend: A Flask server processes incoming data, manages neural network operations, and ensures seamless communication between the frontend and the model.
Cutting-Edge Technology: Incorporates state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to analyze and predict market trends.

How It Works
Data Ingestion: The system takes in timestamped financial data as input.
Neural Network Analysis: A deep neural network processes the data, identifying patterns and trends.
Prediction Generation: The model outputs predictions for the high, low, and closing values of the upcoming financial candle.
Result Display: Predictions are displayed on the web interface, providing users with timely information.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Flask
Deep Learning: Custom-built neural network models
Data Processing: Efficient handling of time-series data for real-time analysis

This project is not only a testament to the capabilities of neural networks in financial forecasting but also serves as a platform for further research and development in the field of AI-driven finance.
